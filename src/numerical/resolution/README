Maternal Effects and Parent-Offspring Conflict
Bram Kuijper & Rufus A Johnstone

Numerical iterations 

files:
auxiliary.h: header file with auxiliary functions in terms of filenames and number generation
compile.sh: to compile the numerical iterations
eigenvectors_battle.txt: eigenvectors for the battleground model (export from Mathematica)
eigenvectors.txt: eigenvectors for the resolution model (export from Mathematica)
generate_cpp.py: python script which generates a c++ file from the txt files
generate_iters.py: python script which generates permutations of parameter combinations
resolution_numerical.cpp: base c++ file to which mathematica expressions are added
run_conflict.sh: a testrun file
selgrad_mother_battle.txt: maternal selection gradients, battleground model (export from Mathematica)
selgrad_offspring_battle.txt: offspring selection gradients, battleground model (export from Mathematica)
selgrad.txt: selection gradients resolution model (export from Mathematica)

Requirements:
GNU Scientific Library
a C compiler, like gcc.
Python 3
Compiling of the C file takes at least 20Gb of RAM and takes 20 minutes

Compile as follows
bash compile.sh

Then generate some parameter permutations by running the python script 'generate_runs.py'
./generate_iters.py > batch_file.sh

Then run the batch file to run the numerical models
bash batch_file.sh
